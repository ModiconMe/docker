## Installation

### Linux

Run this quick and easy install script provided by Docker:

```sh
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

If you're not willing to run a random shell script, please see the [installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/) instructions for your distribution.

If you are a complete Docker newbie, you should follow the [series of tutorials](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/) now.

### Windows 10

Instructions to install Docker Desktop for Windows can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

Once installed, open powershell as administrator and run:

```powershell
# Display the version of docker installed:
docker version

# Pull, create, and run 'hello-world':
docker run hello-world
```

To continue, right click the Docker icon in the system tray, and go to settings. In order to mount volumes, the C:/ drive will need to be enabled in the settings to that information can be passed into the containers (later described in this article).

To switch between Windows containers and Linux containers, right click the icon in the system tray and click the button to switch container operating system Doing this will stop the current containers that are running, and make them unaccessible until the container OS is switched back.

Additionally, if you have WSL or WSL2 installed on your desktop, you might want to install the Linux Kernel for Windows. Instructions can be found [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-dev-appconsult/using-wsl2-in-a-docker-linux-container-on-windows-to-run-a/ba-p/1482133). This requires the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature. This will allow for containers to be accessed by WSL operating systems, as well as the efficiency gain from running WSL operating systems in docker. It is also preferred to use [Windows terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started) for this.

### Check Version

* [`docker version`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/version/) shows which version of docker you have running.
